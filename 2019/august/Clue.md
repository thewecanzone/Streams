# Clue in Minecraft

On August 13th I started making Clue in Minecraft!

## Game Board
To make Clue, we needed a gameboard. For that I made 9 square rooms around a 
world I was using in Minecraft.

| Room Name | Location | Command | 
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| Canyon | 1322,25,179 | |
| Water | 1313, 99, 526 | |
| Hill | 1208, 64, 698 | | 
| River | | |
| Swamp | | |
| Sky | 1303, 152, 650 | |
| TreeHouse | 1261, 75, 372 | | 
| Sand | | | 
| Cliff | | |
